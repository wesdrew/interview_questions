1.17.18

	- suspect that my implementation is not set up correctly 
	    - 1. recursive calls may not be called by the correct caller
	       so not delegating tasks to subtrees, responsibilities for
	       populating the tree are garbled

	- renamed _head to _root and generally made references in functions clearer at 
	  the expense of more lines of code
	- missed case in _remove where a subtree might have no right or left subtrees
	- having trouble adding more than one value to the tree, None is being assigned
	  to self._root when recursive calls unwind

	- now at frustration point where I tear it down and start again

	- removing left, right pointers from BST_Node and putting them in the BST

        - found problem with remove...it's not removing the head node!


1.16.18:

	- a node's data was originally represented using dicts but changing that to
	  tuples because that seems less wasteful
