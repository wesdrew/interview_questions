David has n  containers and n  different types of balls, both of which are numbered 
from 0 to n-1 . The distribution of ball types per container are described by an
matrix of integers, M, where each cell is the number of balls of type n in container n.



In a single operation, David can swap two balls located in different containers (i.e., one ball is moved from container  to  and the other ball is moved from  to ).


David wants to perform some number of swap operations such that both of the following conditions are satisfied:

Each container contains only balls of the same type.
No two balls of the same type are located in different containers.
You must perform  queries where each query is in the form of a matrix, . For each query, print Possible on a new line if David can satisfy the conditions above for the given matrix; otherwise, print Impossible instead.
