1.11.18

- pulled out function macros
- forgot to decrement list_size in remove methods
- actually just starting over dangnabbit 
  - want node to have its own header and c file
  - include guard added to node.h
  - added tests for node
  - need to see if node still works when node is created dynamically
  - forgot append, pop, and dequeue methods for list! 
    - need to add type checking for append method

  - problem with pop -- getting gibberish from data pointer passed to pop

  - makefile always recompiles...doesn't check if files are up to date

list_remove_head:
	- return type: node or data in node? 
	- if returning the node, make sure the pointers of node
	are pointing to NULL
	- MAKE SURE THERES SOMETHING IN THE LIST DUMMY
	
list_remove_tail:
	- caught myself not using function macro


make_file:
	- hate hate hate makefiles

link_test.c:
	- just testing whether we compile (makefile works etc.) 
	   going to use a dummy destroy function and (char *) as data type 
	   for linked_list
	- can't use function macros from main function since list and 
	node were declared inside main 


	START HERE	- not getting ANY output to stdout
